## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally or customize it, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/birthday-page.git
     ```
   - Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - No additional dependencies are required beyond a web browser, but for development, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

3. **Prepare Files**:

   - Place your personal photos (e.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`) in the project folder.
   - Ensure the Apple Music embed works with your iTunes purchase (no local file needed).

4. **Run Locally**:

   - Open the project folder in VS Code.
   - Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" to preview the webpage.
   - Test the slideshow, confetti, love letter, and music player.

5. **Customize**:
   - Edit `index.html` to change the name in `<h1 id="birthdayHeader">` and the love letter in `<p id="loveLetter">`.
   - Add more photos by duplicating `<div class="slide">` blocks in `index.html`.
   - Modify `styles.css` to adjust colors or the shimmer effect.

## Usage

- **Open the Webpage**: Visit the deployed URL (or open `index.html` locally) to experience the surprise.
- **Interact**:
  - Click "Celebrate!" to trigger red heart confetti.
  - Click "Open me" to view a personal message.
  - Click the Apple Music player to start "No Strings" (autoplay may require interaction due to browser policies).
